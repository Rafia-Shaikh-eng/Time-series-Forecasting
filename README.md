### Project Description 
<p>The study utilized daily bitcoin prices (opening and closing prices) time-series data from 2015 to 2020. A time series approach was applied, including models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, ARCH, GARCH, and FB_PROPHET. The analysis found that the behavior of bitcoin prices was non-stationary, as confirmed by the Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests. To address this, the data was made stationary through differencing. The best hyperparameters for the model were selected using a grid search and the MSE criteria. The project was implemented using Python programming.</p>
